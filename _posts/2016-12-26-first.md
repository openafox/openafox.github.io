excerpt: Pulling from the old to create the new (a lot of catch up to do).

I am excited to finally (2+ years in the making) have a new website hosted on [GitHub-Pages](https://pages.github.com/){: target="_blank"}. I have a lot of work to do to get my old content updated and  on here plus all the new stuff I intend to add. 

My plan is to date all the old post 2012-01-01 to just lump them together. As I add new stuff I will add the actual date I add/update.

Wish me luck,

Austin
