excerpt: I never documented this for myself so I have to figure it out again now...

Following the instructions on [github help](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) plus some missing details.

clone site (in my case):

`git clone  https://github.com/openafox/openafox.github.io.git`

cd into the directory.

Now we need to install the goods.

First we need to install ruby:

`sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential`

Then check the version:

`ruby -v`

Then install Bundler to help reduce build errors:

`gem install bundler`

I did not set my original site up with a gem file so I had to create one (skip if
you have a gem file):

`bundle init`

add github-pages gem to the newly created gemfile:

`gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins`

Install the gems:

`bundle install`

Check the github-pages gem install:

`bundle update github-pages`

Serve locally:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Profit!
