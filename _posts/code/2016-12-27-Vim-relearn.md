excerpt: Three years or so after initially learning and setting up Vim, I do it again and try to document all I learned.

I will be updating this post over the next few weeks as I fine tune my vim setup. 

## Installing Vim

This is part of my macports port install script (I will add a link to this once I make that post).

## Learning Vim Commands

I currently only know and use a handful of vim commands. Luckily there are a bunch of good resources available. For now I am starting with the [viemu Graphical vi-vim Cheat Sheet][vim].

## Vimrc - lets make vim awesome

This is a crazy topic but luckily it is also covered really in depth in [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way][vimscript]. My plan is to put my .vimrc on git once I am fairly happy with it. I will comment the shit out of it so when you look at it and when I look at it a year from now we can all understand what everything is doing.
