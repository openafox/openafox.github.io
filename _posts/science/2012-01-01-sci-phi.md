I intend to write a detailed explanation of my views but for now here is a very short summation.

Science is not about finding 'The Answer' but, rather, is about learning how to ask better questions and gaining collective knowledge.

Here are two great TED talks about how science really works:

* [Why truly innovative science demands a leap into the unknown][Uri] is given by a Physics prof, Uri Alon.  He talks about how A does not usually get to B but rather ends up at C, what he calls the cloud, and using "Yes and" to become more creative in how you do science. 

* [The pursuit of ignorance][Stuart] given by Stuart Firestein, who studies smell, is about how science is really just "farting around in the dark".  The propagation of questions.
