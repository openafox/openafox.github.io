excerpt: A couple of manuals I made during grad school.

Many of us have found that a good manual is hard to find.  I am not saying my manuals are any different but here they are anyhow. Many of these are compilations of bad manuals or in some cases complete one-offs. As I state on my home page these are licensed CC BY 4.0 and I would really appreciate any critiques that would better these Manuals.
