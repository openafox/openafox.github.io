I have a number of my own ideas about the issues with our education system and what we can do to move into something better. There are many people who are more qualified and have more ability to make changes than I do but many of them are so entrenched it is hard to dig themselves out. I will elaborate on this soon but for now here are two fantastic TED talks by Sir Ken Robinson.

[How to Escape Education's Death Valley](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_how_to_escape_education_s_death_valley){: target="_blank"}

"There are three sorts of people in the world: Those who are immovable, people who don't get it, or don't want to do anything about it; there are people who are movable, people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it; and there are people who move, people who make things happen." -*Benjamin Franklin*

And if we can encourage more people, that will be a movement. And if the movement is strong enough, that's, in the best sense of the word, a revolution. And that's what we need.
