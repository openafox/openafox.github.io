# Welcome

My name is Austin Fox and I am a graduate student in materials engineering, a non-profit Board member, and an advocate for change. I have created this site as an outlet for my work and ideas, in the hope that they can be beneficial to others. Everything posted on the site (except external links) is licensed CC BY 4.0 which means you are free to share or adapt any of it as long as you attribute where you got it.

Please understand that I do express a few of my opinions on this site, some of which you may not agree with. I acknowledge that I may be wrong, and at the same time, my opinions have been formed by my experiences and vast amounts of research. I expect/hope that my opinions will always be changing in some fashion and I will update the site to reflect my current understanding. If you do not agree with my opinions, please contact me with respectful questions or comments with citations of research publications; most anything else will be ignored.

If things on this site are unclear or could be made better (minus opinions), please feel free to send me an email. I appreciate any collaboration that can help progress your or my own work. For the most part, I will be posting .pdf files of my work. If .doc files are needed, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me. 
Thanks for reading!

Sincere regards,

Austin Fox
